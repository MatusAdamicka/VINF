Cetuximab,Cetuximab is an endothelial growth factor receptor binding fragment used to treat colorectal cancer as well as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,Cetuximab,DB00002,"Cetuximab is a recombinant chimeric human/mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody that competitively binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF).4 EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases found in both normal and tumour cells; it is responsible for regulating epithelial tissue development and homeostasis.9 EGFR has been implicated in various types of cancer, as it is often overexpressed in malignant cells 4 and EGFR overexpression has been linked to more advanced disease and poor prognosis.3 EGFR is often mutated in certain types of cancer and serves as a driver of tumorigenesis.9 In vitro, cetuximab was shown to mediate anti-tumour effects in numerous cancer cell lines and human tumour xenografts.3Approved by the FDA in February 2004 under the brand name ERBITUX, cetuximab is used for the treatment of head and neck cancer and metastatic, KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer.3 It has also been investigated in advanced colorectal cancer, EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer.12 Cetuximab is administered via intravenous infusion and is used as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies, including platinum agents, radiation therapy, leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan.11",Biotech,Approved,Protein Based TherapiesMonoclonal antibody (mAb),,C6484H10042N1732O2023S36,145781.6 Da,>Cetuximab heavy chainQVQLKQSGPGLVQPSQSLSITCTVSGFSLTNYGVHWVRQSPGKGLEWLGVIWSGGNTDYNTPFTSRLSINKDNSKSQVFFKMNSLQSNDTAIYYCARALTYYDYEFAYWGQGTLVTVSAASTKGPSVFPLAPSSKSTSGGTAALGCLVKDYFPEPVTVSWNSGALTSGVHTFPAVLQSSGLYSLSSVVTVPSSSLGTQTYICNVNHKPSNTKVDKKVEPKSCDKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMISRTPEVTCVVVDVSHEDPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQYNSTYRVVSVLTVLHQDWLNGKEYKCKVSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTCLVKGFYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGK>Cetuximab light chainDILLTQSPVILSVSPGERVSFSCRASQSIGTNIHWYQQRTNGSPRLLIKYASESISGIPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLSINSVESEDIADYYCQQNNNWPTTFGAGTKLELKRTVAAPSVFIFPPSDEQLKSGTASVVCLLNNFYPREAKVQWKVDNALQSGNSQESVTEQDSKDSTYSLSSTLTLSKADYEKHKVYACEVTHQGLSSPVTKSFNRGECReferences:Therapeutic Targets Database: TTD Biologic drug sequences in fasta format [Link] Download FASTA Format,CetuximabCétuximabCetuximabum,"Cetuximab indicated for the treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with radiation therapy.

On the contrary, cetuximab does not exert its anti-tumour effects on human tumour xenografts lacking EGFR expression.3,11Cetuximab potentiates the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy when used in combination.11 In human tumour xenograft models in mice, cetuximab and irinotecan synergistically inhibited the growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts in vitro and in vivo. Cetuximab potentiated the in vitro anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of irinotecan and achieved 93% in vivo inhibition of tumour growth when combined with irinotecan, compared to 77% and 79% inhibition when cetuximab and irinotecan were used alone, respectively.5","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.11 When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.12Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.2,11 Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat).2,8 Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.3 Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.8,11 In vitro, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.5 Binding of cetuximab to EGFR also results in internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to an overall downregulation of EGFR expression.4K-ras is a small G-protein downstream of EGFR that plays an important role in promoting the EGFR signalling cascade: in some malignant cells, K-ras can acquire activating mutations in exon 2 12 and thus be continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation.11 Since mutant Ras proteins can isolate the pathway from the effect of EGFR, K-Ras mutations can render EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab ineffective in exerting anti-tumour effects.11,12 Cetuximab is thus only limited in its use for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing cancers.11TargetActionsOrganismAEpidermal growth factor receptorbinderHumansULow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III-BbinderHumansUComplement C1q subcomponent subunit AbinderHumansUComplement C1q subcomponent subunit BbinderHumansUComplement C1q subcomponent subunit CbinderHumansULow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III-AbinderHumansUHigh affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor IbinderHumansULow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-abinderHumans","After administration of a 400 mg/m2 initial dose followed by a 250 mg/m2 weekly dose, the steady-state levels of cetuximab was reached by the third weekly infusion with mean peak and trough concentrations across studies ranging from 168 µg/mL to 235 µg/mL and 41 µg/mL to 85 µg/mL, respectively.11 Tmax is about 3 hours.3",The volume of the distribution is about 2-3 L/m2 and is independent of dose.11,There is no information available.,"Like other monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab is expected to undergo lysosomal degradation by the reticuloendothelial system and protein catabolism by a target‐mediated disposition pathway.6",There is limited information available.,"After administration of a 400 mg/m2 initial dose followed by a 250 mg/m2 weekly dose, the mean half-life for cetuximab was approximately 112 hours, with a range of 63 to 230 hours.11","In patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, the estimated clearance rate was 0.103 L/h.7 At doses ranging from 200 to 400 mg/m2, complete saturation of systemic clearance was observed.

These thick secretions contribute both to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity. The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection, nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals.","Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human DNase I. The enzyme is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phosphooligonucleotide end products. It has no effect on intracellular DNA. Optimal activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. Extracellular DNA is a viscous anionic polymer and its breakdown appears to improve the viscosity and viscoelasticity of purulent sputum of individuals with CF, thus reducing airflow obstruction. Dornase alfa does not seem to have any effect on non-purulent sputum.TargetActionsOrganismADNANot AvailableHumans",Studies in rats and monkeys after inhalation of dornase alfa shows very little systemic absorption (less than 15% for rats and less than 2% for monkeys).

Bivalirudin,Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor used to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and to prevent thrombosis during percutaneous coronary intervention.,Bivalirudin,DB00006,"Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide (thrombin inhibitor) which reversibly inhibits thrombin. Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. It is administered intravenously. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure.",Small Molecule,"Approved, Investigational",,,,,,BivalirudinBivalirudinaBivalirudinum,"For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis.

The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin.,"Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding both to its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release.TargetActionsOrganismAProthrombininhibitorHumans","Following intravenous administration, bivalirudin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics.

Leuprolide,"Leuprolide is a peptide-based GnRH receptor superagonist used for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer, uterine leiomyomata, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.",Leuprolide,DB00007,"Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.4 As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.1,3Leuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron™ by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.11 Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.6,9 Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.",Small Molecule,"Approved, Investigational",,,,,,LeuprorelinLeuprorelinaLeuprorelineLeuprorelinum,"Leuprolide is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer6,9 as well as for the treatment of pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP).7,8 Leuprolide mesylate, as an injectable emulsion, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer.12 In combination with oral norethisterone (also known as norethindrone), leuprolide is also indicated for the initial treatment of the symptoms of endometriosis.5 Finally, in combination with iron supplementation, leuprolide is indicated for the preoperative hematological improvement of anemic patients with uterine leiomyomata (uterine fibroids).10Reduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See howBuild, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how","Avoid life-threatening adverse drug eventsImprove clinical decision support with information on contraindications & blackbox warnings, population restrictions, harmful risks, & more.Learn moreAvoid life-threatening adverse drug events & improve clinical decision support.Learn more","Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that functions as a GnRH receptor superagonist.3,4 After an initial spike in GnRH-mediated steroidal production, including testosterone and estradiol, prolonged use results in a significant drop in circulating steroid levels, in line with those produced through other forms of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).1,2,3 The corresponding hormonal/steroidal changes produce specific adverse effects in different patient populations.In women undergoing treatment for endometriosis or uterine leiomyomata, careful consideration regarding pregnancy status is advised. The initial increase in estradiol levels may worsen symptoms such as pain and bleeding. Long-term use of leuprolide is associated with loss of bone mineral density. Patients co-administered with norethisterone may experience sudden vision loss, proptosis, diplopia, migraine, thrombophlebitis, and pulmonary embolism and may also be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with a history of depression may experience severe recurrence of depressive symptoms.5,10In men undergoing palliative treatment for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer, short-term spikes in testosterone levels may cause tumour flare and associated symptoms such as bone pain, hematuria, neuropathy, bladder and/or ureteral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. In addition, patients are at increased risk of developing hyperglycemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which may manifest through myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac death, or prolonged QT/QTc interval. In addition, Leuprolide may cause convulsions and embryo-fetal toxicity.6,9In pediatric patients undergoing treatment for central precocious puberty (CPP), the initial steroidal spike may be associated with increased clinical signs of puberty within 2-4 weeks of treatment initiation. In addition, leuprolide may cause convulsions and psychiatric symptoms, including irritability, impatience, aggression, anger, and crying.7,8","Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a naturally occurring decapeptide that modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. GnRH binds to corresponding receptors (GnRHRs) on the anterior pituitary gonadotropes, which in turn release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); these, in turn, affect the downstream synthesis and release of the sex hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, and estradiol.1,3Despite the variety of conditions indicated for treatment with leuprolide, the mechanism of action underlying efficacy is the same in all cases. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit. These effects are reversible upon treatment discontinuation.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10TargetActionsOrganismAGonadotropin-releasing hormone receptoragonistHumans","Leuprolide is typically administered as a single-dose long-acting formulation employing either microsphere or biodegradable solid depot technologies.1 Regardless of the exact formulation and initial dose strength, the Cmax is typically achieved by 4-5 hours post-injection and displays large variability in the range of 4.6 - 212 ng/mL. Eventual steady-state kinetics are typically achieved by four weeks, with a narrower range of 0.1 - 2 ng/mL.

Peginterferon alfa-2a,Peginterferon alfa-2a is a modified form of recombinant human interferon used to stimulate the innate antiviral response in the treatment of hepatitis B and C viruses.,Peginterferon alfa-2a,DB00008,"Peginterferon alfa-2a is a form of recombinant interferon used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients 3. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from the alfa-2a moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2a has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2a for the treatment of Hepatitis C 1. Peginterferon alfa-2a was used alongside Ribavirin with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality 2.Peginterferon alfa-2a is available as a fixed dose injector (tradename Pegasys) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in 2002 by the FDA, Pegasys is indicated for the treatment of HCV with Ribavirin or other antiviral drugs Label. When combined together, Peginterferon alfa-2a and Ribavirin have been shown to achieve a SVR between 36% for genotype 1 and 59% for genotypes 2-6 after 48 weeks of treatment.",Biotech,"Approved, Investigational",Protein Based TherapiesInterferons,,Not Available,60000.0 Da,>Peginterferon alfa-2a sequenceCDLPQTHSLGSRRTLMLLAQMRRISLFSCLKDRHDFGFPQEEFGNQFQKAETIPVLHEMIQQIFNLFSTKDSSAAWDETLLDKFYTELYQQLNDLEACVIQGVGVTETPLMKEDSILAVRKYFQRITLYLKEKKYSPCAWEVVRAEIMRSFSLSTNLQESLRSKEDownload FASTA Format,PEG-IFN alfa-2APEG-Interferon alfa-2APeginterferon alfa-2aPegylated Interfeaon alfa-2APegylated interferon alfa-2aPegylated interferon alpha-2aPegylated-interferon alfa 2a,"Peginterferon alfa-2a is indicated for the treatment of HCV in combination with other antiviral drugs in patients over 5 years of age with compensated liver disease Label.

Hypertension, supraventricular arrhythmias, chest pain, and myocardial infarction have been observed in patients using Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a may produce myelosuppression as well as the development or aggravation of autoimmune disorders including myositis, hepatitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial nephritis, thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Peginterferon alfa-2a causes or aggravates hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus have been observed to develop in patients treated with Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a may decrease or produce loss of vision, retinopathy including macular edema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, optic neuritis, papilledema and serous retinal detachment. Peginterferon mayy be related to increased ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events. Patients with cirrhosis on Peginterferon alfa-2a are at risk of hepatic decompensation. Dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension and sarcoidosis may be induced or aggravated by Peginterferon alfa-2a. Serious and severe infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) have been reported during treatment with Peginterferon alfa-2a. Ulcerative and hemorrhagic/ischemic colitis have been observed within 12 weeks of starting Peginterferon alfa-2a treatment. Pancreatitis and peripheral nephropathy have also been reported.

Erythropoietin interacts withprogenitor stem cells to increase red cell production. Binding of erythropoietin to the erythropoietin receptor leads to receptor dimerization, which facilitates activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways within the cytosol. Activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins are then translocated to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors which regulate the activation of specific genes involved in cell division or differentiation.TargetActionsOrganismAErythropoietin receptoragonistHumans",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,"Improve decision support & research outcomesWith structured adverse effects data, including: blackbox warnings, adverse reactions, warning & precautions, & incidence rates.Learn moreImprove decision support & research outcomes with our structured adverse effects data.Learn more",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

Erythropoietin,Erythropoietin is a recombinant form of human erythropoietin used to increase differentiation of progenitor cells to red blood cells in the treatment of anemia.,Erythropoietin,DB00016,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a growth factor produced in the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells. It works by promoting the division and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow Label. Epoetin alfa (Epoge) was developed by Amgen Inc. in 1983 as the first rhEPO commercialized in the United States, followed by other alfa and beta formulations. Epoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid erythropoiesis-stimulating glycoprotein produced in cell culture using recombinant DNA technology and is used for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with various clinical conditions, such as chronic renal failure, antiviral drug therapy, chemotherapy, or a high risk for perioperative blood loss from surgical procedures Label. It has a molecular weight of approximately 30,400 daltons and is produced by mammalian cells into which the human erythropoietin gene has been introduced. The product contains the identical amino acid sequence of isolated natural erythropoietin and has the same biological activity as the endogenous erythropoietin. Epoetin alfa biosimilar, such as Retacrit (epoetin alfa-epbx or epoetin zeta), has been formulated to allow more access to treatment options for patients in the market 5. The biosimilar is approved by the FDA and EMA as a safe, effective and affordable biological product and displays equivalent clinical efficacy, potency, and purity to the reference product 1.

It is reported to increase the reticulocyte count within 10 days of initiation, followed by increases in the RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks 6. Depending on the dose administered, the rate of hemoglobin increase may vary. In patients receiving hemodialysis, a greater biologic response is not observed at doses exceeding 300 Units/kg 3 times weekly 6. Epoetin alfa serves to restore erythropoietin deficiency in pathological and other clinical conditions where normal production of erythropoietin is impaired or compromised. In anemic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), administration with epoetin alfa stimulated erythropoiesis by increasing the reticulocyte count within 10 days, followed by increases in the red cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks Label. Epoetin alfa was shown to be effective in increasing hematocrit in zidovudine-treated HIV-infected patients and anemic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy Label.","Erythropoietin or exogenous epoetin alfa binds to the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and activates intracellular signal transduction pathways 3. The affinity (Kd) of EPO for its receptor on human cells is ∼100 to 200 pM 4. Upon binding to EPO-R on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, a conformational change is induced which brings EPO-R-associated Janus family tyrosine protein kinase 2 (JAK2) molecules into close proximity. JAK2 molecules are subsequently activated via phosphorylation, then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R that serve as docking sites for Src homology 2-domain-containing intracellular signaling proteins 3. The signalling proteins include STAT5 that once phosphorylated by JAK2, dissociates from the EPO-R, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors to activate target genes involved in cell division or differentiation, including the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-x 3. The inhibition of apoptosis by the EPO-activated JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-x pathway is critical in erythroid differentiation. Via JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, erythropoietin and epoetin alfa also activates other intracellular proteins involved in erythroid cell proliferation and survival, such as Shc , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-γ1 3.

This leads to a net increase in bone mass and a reduction in plasma calcium levels. It also promotes the renal excretion of ions such as calcium, phosphate, sodium, magnesium, and potassium by decreasing tubular reabsorption. In consequence, there is an increase in the jejunal secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and chloride.","Calcitonin binds to the calcitonin receptor (found primarily in osteoclasts) which then enhances the production of vitamin D producing enzymes (25-hydroxyvitamine D-24-hydroxylase), leading to greater calcium retention and enhanced bone density.

While research in animals have shown a decrease in fetal weight, no studies have yet shown similar results in humans. It is recommended however to proceed carefully when administering salmon calcitonin to pregnant women and consider if the benefits outweigh the risks. Because of its protein nature, salmon calcitonin may provoke an allergy reaction (bronchospams and swelling of the tongue/throat) that can turn into a full-blown anaphylactic response. The manufacturer also reports an increase in the risk of malignancies from oral route (0.7%) to intranasal route (2.4%) compared to placebo.

Pegfilgrastim,Pegfilgrastim is a recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor used to stimulate the production of neutrophils and prevent febrile neutropenia or infections after myelosuppressive chemotherapy.,Pegfilgrastim,DB00019,"Pegfilgrastim is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analogue, filgrastim.2 It is used to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with with non-myeloid cancer receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer treatment. Some patients with greater risk factors may develop febrile neutropenia from myelosuppressive therapy and are susceptible to an increased risk of developing infections. Although the risk of developing febrile neutropenia is less than 20% in many readily used chemotherapy regimens,9 infections pose risks of hospitalization and mortalities.4 Due to the relatively short circulating half-life of filgrastim, a 20 kDa PEG moiety was covalently conjugated to the N-terminus of filgrastim (at the methionine residue) to develop a longer acting version of the drug.1,3 Due to a longer half-life and slower elimination rate than filgrastim, pegfilgrastim requires less frequent dosing than filgrastim. However, pegfilgrastim retains the same biological activity as filgrastim and binds to the same G-CSF receptor to stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of neutrophils.3First developed by Amgen, pegfilgrastim was initially approved by the FDA in 2002 and marketed as Neulasta®. It is typically administered via a subcutaneous injection. There are several pegfilgrastim biosimilars (Fulphila®, Pelgraz® or Lapelga®, Pelmeg®, Udenyca®, Ziextenzo®, and Grasustek®) that are approved for the same therapeutic indication by Health Canada, European Union (EU), and FDA.8,10 These biosimilars are highly similar to the reference product, Neulasta®, in terms of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile and condition(s) of use, such as the therapeutic indication(s), dosing regimen(s), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration.11",Biotech,Approved,Protein Based TherapiesHaematopoietic growth factors,,C845H1343N223O243S9,"39000.0 Da (approximate, PEGylated)",> Pegfilgrastim sequenceMTPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLCATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQPDownload FASTA Format,Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor pegfilgrastimpeg-filgrastimPegfilgrastimpegfilgrastim-apgfpegfilgrastim-bmezpegfilgrastim-cbqvpegfilgrastim-jmdb,"Pegfilgrastim is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non­ myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.6It is also indicated to increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Subsyndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome).6Reduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See howBuild, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how","Avoid life-threatening adverse drug eventsImprove clinical decision support with information on contraindications & blackbox warnings, population restrictions, harmful risks, & more.Learn moreAvoid life-threatening adverse drug events & improve clinical decision support.Learn more","Pegfilgrastim is a recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that promotes the production, proliferation, and maturation of neutrophils, which are white blood cells involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses.4,9 The safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in reducing the risk of febrile neutropenia and infections have been demonstrated in various tumor types and settings.4 During chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, the clearance of pegfilgrastim is significantly reduced and the concentration of pegfilgrastim is sustained until the onset of neutrophil recovery.1 Serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim decline as the neutrophil count increases as neutrophil and neutrophil precursors are involved in cell-mediated clearance of the drug.2 Due the addition of polyethylene glycol group to its structure, Pegfilgrastim is a long-acting form of filgrastim with an extended serum half-life and reduced renal clearance.3 Although it is more slowly absorbed than filgrastim, self-regulation of pegfilgrastim is more efficient and the drug effects are maintained during one chemotherapy cycle (2-3 weeks).1","Neutrophils are short-lived immune cells that are highly susceptible to cell death following myelosuppressive chemotherapy. This marked reduction in neutrophil numbers during chemotherapy increases the risk of hospitalization, infection, and infection-related mortality. It also directly impacts the clinical outcome of patients if cases of febrile neutropenia requires dose reductions or schedule delay of chemotherapy, thus reducing the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy and patient benefit from receiving appropriate treatment.4 G-CSF is an endogenous haematopoietic growth factor that stimulates granulopoietic cells of the neutrophil lineage. Pegfilgrastim mimics its biological actions and binds to the same G-CSF receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage, such as granulocytic precursors and mature neutrophils.1 Upon binding of the ligand, G-CSF receptor undergoes a conformational change and activates several downstream signalling pathways including JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK.5 These pathways work to increase proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte progenitor cells, induce maturation of the progenitor cells, and enhance survival and function of mature neutrophils.1TargetActionsOrganismAGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptoragonistHumans",Pegfilgrastim has a lower absolute bioavailability than filgrastim following subcutaneous administration. The absorption of pegfilgrastim is largely dependent on the lymphatic system due to the attached PEG group contributing to the large size of the drug. It is slowly absorbed following subcutaneous administration with a time to peak concentration (Tmax) of about 1-2 days.1,Pegfilgrastim appears to have a volume of distribution of approximately 170L.[A33290],The plasma protein binding of pegfilgrastim is unlikely.12,"It is not know whether pegfilgrastim is metabolized into major metabolites.12 Once it binds to the therapeutic target, pegfilgrastim is internalized by the neutrophil and undergoes nonspecific degradation.1","The polyethylene glycol moiety limits the renal clearance by glomerular filtration of pegfilgrastim, making neutrophil-mediated clearance as the predominant route of elimination.3 This elimination pathway is initiated by the binding of pegfilgrastim to the G-CSF receptor on the neutrophil cell surface, leading to the internalization of the pegfilgrastim-receptor complex via endocytosis and subsequent degradation inside the cell. While hepatic clearance has not been well characterized for pegfilgrastim, its non-PEGylated precursor filgrastim is known to be unaffected by changes in hepatic clearance.1","The serum half-life of Pegfilgrastim is highly variable depending on the absolute neutrophil count, with the range of 15 to 80 hours following subcutaneous administration. The median serum half-life of 42 hours.3,6","Pegfilgrastim has a self-regulating clearance that involves neutrophil-induced clearance.1,4 The clearance is dependent on the number of neutrophils and body weight of the patient: the clearance increases with increasing number of granulocytes and lower body weights.6 Pegfilgrastim is not eliminated from the circulation until neutrophils start to recover following chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its clearance is increased as neutrophil counts also increase.4 The apparent serum clearance is 14 mL/h/kg.12","Improve decision support & research outcomesWith structured adverse effects data, including: blackbox warnings, adverse reactions, warning & precautions, & incidence rates.Learn moreImprove decision support & research outcomes with our structured adverse effects data.Learn more","The maximum safe dose of pegfilgrastim has not been established; however, the highest dose used in clinical trials was 300 mcg/kg.9 Overdosage of pegfilgrastim may result in leukocytosis and bone pain.

Secretin human,"Secretin human is a secretin hormone used to stimulate pancreatic or gastric secretions to diagnose exocrine pancreas dysfunction, gastrinoma, and abnormalities in the bile and pancreatic ducts.",Secretin human,DB09532,"Human secretin is a gastrointestinal peptide hormone that regulates secretions in the stomach, pancreas, and liver. The hormone is produced from the enterochromaffin cells in the duodenum in response to the duodenal content with the pH less than 4.5 5. The main action of secretin is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice for pH regulation in the small intestines. Secretin is also responsible in body fluid homeostasis 4 and bile production. Although it is a gastrointestinal hormone, secretin is also considered as a neuropeptide hormone since it is also expressed in the central nervous system 3.Purified synthetic human secretin, also referred to as RG1068, is available as an intravenous injection under the market name ChiRhoStim ® in the U.S.. It contains an amino acid sequence identical to the naturally occurring hormone consisting of 27 amino acids Label that supports α-helical formation 3. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid, valine, is amidated. Synthetic human secretin displays equivalent biological activity and properties as naturally-occurring secretin 1. It is indicated for the stimulation of the pancreatic and gastric secretions to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction and the diagnosis of gastrinoma, and facilitate the identification of the ampulla of Vater and accessory papilla during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).",Biotech,Approved,Protein Based TherapiesHormones,,C130H220N44O39,3039.44 Da,>Human SecretinHSDGTFTSELSRLREGARLQRLLQGLVDownload FASTA Format,Human secretinSecretinSecretin (human)Secretin humanSecretin synthetic humanSynthetic human secretin,"Indicated for the stimulation of:pancreatic secretions, including bicarbonate, to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction Label.gastrin secretion to aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma Label.pancreatic secretions to facilitate the identification of the ampulla of Vater and accessory papilla during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Label.Reduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See howBuild, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how","Avoid life-threatening adverse drug eventsImprove clinical decision support with information on contraindications & blackbox warnings, population restrictions, harmful risks, & more.Learn moreAvoid life-threatening adverse drug events & improve clinical decision support.Learn more","In clinical trials, intravenous administration of synthetic human secretin stimulated the exocrine pancreas to promote juice and bicarbonate secretion, with variable responses depending on the pancreatic function of the individual Label. Having an identical amino acid sequence to the biologically-derived secretin, synthetic human secretin exhibits an equivalent biological activity as the natural hormone. The biological activity of synthetic human secretin was approximately 5.0 CU per mcg Label. In patients with suspected or known exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, a volume response of less than 2 mL/kg/hr, peak bicarbonate concentration of less than 80 mEq/L, and a bicarbonate output of less than 0.2 mEq/kg/hr following intravenous synthetic human secretin Label. Administration in healthy subjects in three crossover studies led to overall pancreatic secretory response of a mean peak bicarbonate concentration of 100 mEq/L, a mean total volume over one hour of 260.7 mL, and a peak bicarbonate concentrations ≥ 80 mEq/L Label. In a baseline-controlled study of patients with acute and acute recurrent pancreatitis undergoing magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), administration of synthetic human secretin resulted in higher levels of sensitivity with minimal loss in specificity. This indicates that the stimulation of pancreatic secretions by synthetic secretin facilitates the diagnosis and clinical decision making of patients acute, acute recurrent, or chronic pancreatitis 2.","Synthetic human secretin mediates the same biological effects as the naturally-occurring gastrointestinal peptide hormone. Secretin is normally released from enterochromaffin cells and S cells in the intestinal mucosa of duodenum upon exposure of proximal intestinal lumen to the acidic gastric content, or fatty acids and amino acids Label. Secretin mediates an inhibitory effect on acid secretion by parietal cells of the stomach, and causes alkalinazation of the duodenal content by stimulating the release of pancreatic juice, which has high amounts of water and bicarbonate ions 5. Bicarbonate ions are released into the duodenum from the centroacinar cells, and epithelia lining the pancreatic and biliary ducts 3. Human secretin is a ligand at G-protein coupled secretin receptors which are expressed in the basolateral domain of several tissue cell types 3, including pancreas, stomach, liver, colon and other tissues Label. Upon interaction, levels of cAMP increase and initiates the cAMP-mediated signalling cascade that results in phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and activation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 3. Activation of CFTR activates Cl-/HCO3- anion exchanger 2 and leads to secretion of bicarbonate-rich-pancreatic fluid 3. Via the same cAMP signalling pathway, secretin promotes the secretion of water and electrolytes in cholangiocytes 3. Secretin may work through vagal-vagal neural pathways since stimulation of the efferent vagus nerve stimulates bicarbonate secretion and atropine blocks secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion Label. Additionally, secretin acts as a diuretic to increase urinary volume and bicarbonate excretion 3,4.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients 3. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2b. Peginterferon alfa-2b is derived from the alfa-2b moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2b is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2b has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2b for the treatment of Hepatitis C 2. Peginterferon alfa-2b was used alongside Ribavirin(https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00811) with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality 1.Peginterferon alfa-2b is available as a variable dose injectable product (tradename Pegintron) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in 2001 by the FDA, Pegintron is indicated for the treatment of HCV with Ribavirin or other antiviral drugs Label.

Asparaginase Escherichia coli,Asparaginase Escherichia coli is an asparaginase enzyme from E. coli used as part of treatment regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemias.,Asparaginase Escherichia coli,DB00023,"Asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli (L-asparagine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.1) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of L-asparagine, by catalyzing L-asparagine into L-aspartic acid and ammonia. It also facilitates the production of oxaloacetate which is needed for general cellular metabolism. Asparaginase from E. coli has clinically shown to exhibit antitumor actions in models of leukaemias 1,2. L-asparaginase of E. coli is marketed under several different trade names, including Elspar, for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen. It is available as intramuscular or intravenous injections. Therapeutic L-asparaginase from E. coli works by depleting the levels of non-essential amino acid, asparagine, in lymphoblastic leukemic cells thus promoting apoptotic cell death 3. For patients who develop hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived formulations of L-asparaginase, the use of PEGylated or non-PEGylated Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi is recommended 3.",Biotech,"Approved, Investigational",Protein Based TherapiesOther protein based therapies,,C1377H2208N382O442S17,Not Available,>sp|P00805|ASPG2_ECOLI L-asparaginase 2 OS=Escherichia coli (strain K12) GN=ansB PE=1 SV=2MEFFKKTALAALVMGFSGAALALPNITILATGGTIAGGGDSATKSNYTVGKVGVENLVNAVPQLKDIANVKGEQVVNIGSQDMNDNVWLTLAKKINTDCDKTDGFVITHGTDTMEETAYFLDLTVKCDKPVVMVGAMRPSTSMSADGPFNLYNAVVTAADKASANRGVLVVMNDTVLDGRDVTKTNTTDVATFKSVNYGPLGYIHNGKIDYQRTPARKHTSDTPFDVSKLNELPKVGIVYNYANASDLPAKALVDAGYDGIVSAGVGNGNLYKSVFDTLATAAKTGTAVVRSSRVPTGATTQDAEVDDAKYGFVASGTLNPQKARVLLQLALTQTKDPQQIQQIFNQYDownload FASTA Format,AsparaginaseAsparaginase (E. coli)ColaspaseEscherichia coli L-asparaginaseL-asparaginaseL-asparagine amidohydrolase,"Indicated as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Label.Reduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See howBuild, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how","Avoid life-threatening adverse drug eventsImprove clinical decision support with information on contraindications & blackbox warnings, population restrictions, harmful risks, & more.Learn moreAvoid life-threatening adverse drug events & improve clinical decision support.Learn more","In clinical trials of patients with previously untreated, standard-risk ALL, administration of asparaginase resulted in a decrease of plasma asparagine levels from average of 41 μM to less than 3 μM Label.

Native E. coli asparaginase results in asparagine depletion in 14 to 23 days following administration 3.","Asparagine is a non-essential amino acid that maintains DNA, RNA and protein synthesis and promotes cell growth. While healthy and normal cells are capable of obtaining asparagine via dietary intake or synthesizing the asparagine from aspartate via asparagine synthetase activity, lymphoblastic leukemic cells lack the asparagine synthetase enzyme and cannot produce asparagine de novo 3. Thus, leukemic cells rely on exogenous source of asparagine for protein synthesis and cell survival 3. L-asparagine from E. coli serves to deplete plasma levels of asparagine in leukemic cells by converting L-asparagine to L-aspartic acid and ammonia 3, leading to reduced reduced DNA, RNA and protein synthesis; inhibition of cell growth; and ultimately the activation of apoptotic cell-death mechanisms 3.

IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses including inflammatory and immunological responses. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have elevated levels of IL-1. The levels of the naturally occurring IL-1Ra in synovium and synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are not sufficient to compete with the elevated amount of locally produced IL-1. Increasing the levels of IL-1Ra by artificial means reduces the negative effects (cartilage degradation, bone resorption) of IL-1.","Anakinra binds competitively to the Interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), thereby inhibiting the action of elevated levels IL-1 which normally can lead to cartilage degradation and bone resorption.TargetActionsOrganismAInterleukin-1 receptor type 1antagonistHumans","When a 70 mg subcutaneous bolus injection is given to healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability is 95%.

The immunoglobulins target, bind and kill bacterial cells as well as viral particles. IgG is the monomeric immunoglobulin of which there are four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) in differing abundances (66%, 23%, 7% and 4%). IgAs represent about 15% of the immunoglobulins in the blood. These target inhaled or ingested pathogens.","IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists. It also prevents the generation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage by binding active complement components.TargetActionsOrganismAHigh affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor IantagonistHumansAHigh affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor IBantagonistHumansALow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-aantagonistHumansALow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-bantagonistHumansALow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-cantagonistHumansALow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III-AantagonistHumansALow affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III-BantagonistHumansAComplement C3binderHumansAComplement C4-AbinderHumansAComplement C4-BbinderHumansAComplement C5binderHumans",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,">20 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).",Not Available,"Improve decision support & research outcomesWith structured adverse effects data, including: blackbox warnings, adverse reactions, warning & precautions, & incidence rates.Learn moreImprove decision support & research outcomes with our structured adverse effects data.Learn more",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

Insulin human,Insulin human is a recombinant form of human insulin used to control hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.,Insulin human,DB00030,"Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as Metformin, Gliclazide, or Sitagliptin have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. Marketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as Insulin detemir, Insulin degludec, and Insulin glargine to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.Human insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets 6. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA ""black box"" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU. Human Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",Biotech,"Approved, Investigational",Protein Based TherapiesHormones / Insulins,,C257H383N65O77S6,5808.0 Da,>A chainGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN>B chainFVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTDownload FASTA Format,"High molecular weight insulin humanHuman insulinhuman insulin (rDNA)Insulin (human)Insulin humanInsulin human [rDNA origin]Insulin Human RegularInsulin human regular (rDNA)Insulin human, rDNA originInsulin recombinant humanInsulin recombinant purified humanInsulin regularInsulin, humanInsulina regularNeutral insulinRegular Insulin, humanSoluble insulin","Human insulin is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus.Reduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See howBuild, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how","Avoid life-threatening adverse drug eventsImprove clinical decision support with information on contraindications & blackbox warnings, population restrictions, harmful risks, & more.Learn moreAvoid life-threatening adverse drug events & improve clinical decision support.Learn more","Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis).","The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver.Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism.TargetActionsOrganismAInsulin receptoragonistHumansUInsulin-like growth factor 1 receptoractivatorHumansUCarboxypeptidase Emodulatorproduct ofHumansUProtein NOV homologdownregulatorHumansULow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2substrateHumansUInsulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7inhibitorbinderHumans","When injected subcutaneously, the glucose-lowering effect of human insulin begins approximately 30 minutes post-dose. After a single subcutaneous administration of 0.1 unit/kg of human insulin to healthy subjects, peak insulin concentrations occurred between 1.5 to 2.5 hours post-dose. When administered in an inhaled form (as the product Afrezza), the time to maximum serum insulin concentration ranges from 10-20 minutes after oral inhalation of 4 to 48 units of human insulin. Serum insulin concentrations declined to baseline by approximately 60-240 minutes for these dose levels.

Desmopressin,Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin used to reduce renal excretion of water in central diabetes insipidus and nocturia.,Desmopressin,DB00035,"Desmopressin (dDAVP), a synthetic analogue of 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), is an antidiuretic peptide drug modified by deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney 6. The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.Desmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH 2. It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate 3. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults. It is available as a sublingual tablet.",Small Molecule,Approved,,,,,,1-(3-mercaptopropionic acid)-8-D-arginine-vasopressin1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressindDAVPDesmopresinaDesmopressinDesmopressineDesmopressinum,"Indicated for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults who awaken at least 2 times per night to void (intranasal).

It inhibits the binding of IgE to receptors on mast cells and basophils, blocking the IgE-mediated secretion of inflammatory mediators from these cells 1.Mast cell activation and the release of mediators, in response to allergen exposure and IgE, results in a cascade of events. This cascade culminates in the activation of B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and the endothelium. This cellular interaction, as well as the release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors and inflammatory remodeling of the airway results in chronic asthma 2.After 4 weeks of use of this medication in patients with chronic urticaria, it was found that rescue medication use was reduced significantly and quality of life improved 4.","When an environmental allergen first enters the body, is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). It is then processed, and presented to T and B immune cells. This is followed by the activation of B-lymphocyte and production of allergen-specific IgE. This IgE is then released by plasma cells (converted B lymphocytes) and is therefore available to bind to IgE receptors on several other cells 3.IgE binds to high-affinity (Fc€RI) and low-affinity (Fc€RII) receptors on multiple cells of the immune system. Following subsequent antigen exposure, cross-linking of the antigen occurs by several Fc€RI-bound IgE molecules on the surface of both basophils and mast cells. This leads to the activation of mast cells and histamine release, producing a wheal and other symptoms of urticaria 3.The following are explanations of the mechanism of action for both indications of this drug:AsthmaOmalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on the surface of both mast cells and basophils. The reduction in surface-bound IgE on FcεRI-bearing cells limits the degree of release of mediators of the typical allergic response. Treatment with omalizumab also reduces the number of FcεRI receptors on basophils in atopic patients Label.Omalizumab binds to free IgE with a higher affinity than IgE itself binds to the high-affinity Fc€RI receptors found on basophils. Therefore, it decreases the availability of free IgE for binding 3. Omalizumab by itself does not bind to the Fc€RI receptors, nor does the drug bind to receptor-bound IgE. These binding characteristics allow omalizumab to neutralize the typical IgE-mediated responses without causing the degranulation of basophils or cross-linking with basophil-bound IgE 3.Chronic Idiopathic UrticariaOmalizumab binds to IgE and decreases free IgE levels. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells are down-regulated. The mechanism by which these effects of omalizumab result in an improvement of CIU symptoms is unclearLabel.TargetActionsOrganismAHigh affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor subunit alphainhibitorHumansAHigh affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor subunit betainhibitorHumans","After subcutaneous administration in pharmacokinetic studies, omalizumab was absorbed with a mean absolute bioavailability of 62% Label. After the administration of a single subcutanous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, omalizumab was absorbed slowly. The peak serum concentrations peaked after an average of 7­-8 days. In patients with CIU, the peak serum concentration was reached at a similar time after a single SC dose. The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab was linear at doses which were higher than 0.5 mg/kg. In patients with asthma, after several doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after one dose. In patients with CIU, omalizumab showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 75 mg to 600 mg administered as a single subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing from 75mg-300 mg every 4 weeks, trough serum concentrations of omalizumab increased proportionally with the dose Label.","The apparent volume of distribution of omalizumab in patients with asthma after subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 mL/kg. In patients with CIU, the distribution of omalizumab was similar to that in asthmatic patients Label.",Monoclonal antibodies are usually not required to have protein binding studies.,"Monoclonal antibodies, in general, are believed to be internalized in endothelial cells bound to the Fc receptor and rescued from metabolism by recycling. At a later time, they are degraded in the reticuloendothelial system to smaller peptides and amino acids, which can then be used for de-novo protein synthesis 5. Several factors may influence this process, however. These include factors related to the target antigen, antibody, and patient 5.The metabolism of omalizumab is determined by its IgG1 framework, and by its specific binding to IgE. The elimination of omalizumab is dose-dependent. The reticuloendothelial system and the liver are two sites of elimination for IgG (including degradation in the liver reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells) 9, 5. The omalizumab:IgE complexes are thought to be to cleared via interactions with Fc- gamma-Rs (Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII) at rates that are more rapid than that of IgG clearance. The relative clearance of free omalizumab, free IgE, and complexes is summarized as: free IgE clearance > > omalizumab:IgE clearance > omalizumab clearance 9.","Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the liver reticuloendothelial system (RES) and endothelial cells.Intact IgG was also shown to be excreted in bile, in pharmacokinetic studies Label.","In chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) patients, at steady state, based on population pharmacokinetics, omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 24 days Label.In asthmatic patients omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days Label.","In pharmacokinetic studies, the clearance of omalizumab involved IgG clearance as well as clearance by specific binding and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE Label, 9.The apparent clearance averaging 2.4 ± 1.1 mL/kg/day was measured in asthmatic patients Label.In chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) patients, at steady state, based on population pharmacokinetics, omalizumab apparent clearance averaged 240 mL/day (corresponding to 3.0 mL/kg/day for an 80 kg patient)Label.","Improve decision support & research outcomesWith structured adverse effects data, including: blackbox warnings, adverse reactions, warning & precautions, & incidence rates.Learn moreImprove decision support & research outcomes with our structured adverse effects data.Learn more","AnaphylaxisAnaphylaxis may occur rarely with this agent, either after the first dose or multiple doses Label, 2. Anaphylaxis presenting clinically as bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue, has been reported during and after this use of this drug. Therefore, close clinical monitoring should be performed during and shortly after administration Label.Maximum DosageThe maximum tolerated dosage of omalizumab has not yet been determined. Single intravenous (IV) doses of up to 4000 mg have been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity. The highest cumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20 week time period, which was not associated with any toxicities Label.The use in PregnancyThe data with omalizumab use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. Monoclonal antibodies, such as omalizumab, are transported across the placenta in a linear fashion as a pregnancy progresses; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater in frequency during the second and third trimesters Label.In women with inadequately or moderately controlled asthma, the current evidence suggests that there is an increased risk of preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small fetal size Label.The use During BreastfeedingThere is no information regarding the presence of omalizumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production Label.

Lutropin is usually given in combination with follitropin alfa. Together they stimulate the development of a follicle to prepare the reproductive tract for implementation and pregnancy. Lutropin alfa also stimulates the theca cells to produce androgens and the secretion of estradiol by the follicles. Lutropin alfa and follitropin alfa are discontinued once ultrasound assessment and serum estradiol concentrations show sufficient follicular maturation. hCG is then administered to complete follicular maturation and induce ovulation. In females, a LH surge about halfway through the menstrual cycle triggers the onset of ovulation. Lutropin alfa substitutes for endogenous LH and induces rupture of the preovulatory ovarian follicle and oocyte expulsion. Lutropin alfa induces and maintains the corpus luteum, which then secretes progesterone.",Luteinizing hormone binds to a receptor shared with the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) on the ovarian theca (and granulosa) cells and testicular Leydig cells.

Insulin lispro,Insulin lispro is a modified form of fast-acting insulin used to control hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.,Insulin lispro,DB00046,"Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually cause cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as Metformin, Gliclazide, or Sitagliptin have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. Marketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as Insulin detemir, Insulin degludec, or Insulin glargine to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature LYS(B28), PRO(B29), insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin. Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",Biotech,Approved,Protein Based TherapiesHormones / Insulins,,C257H387N65O76S6,5808.0 Da,>A chainGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN>B chainFVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTKPTDownload FASTA Format,"Insulin lisproInsulin lispro (genetical recombination)Insulin lispro (rDNA origin)Insulin lispro protamineInsulin lispro protamine recombinantInsulin lispro recombinantinsulin lispro-aabcInsulin,lispro,human/rDNAInsulin,lispro,protamine/rDNAInsulina lispro","Insulin lispro is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.

In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.","Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and m-cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties. TargetActionsOrganismAInsulin receptoragonistHumansUInsulin-like growth factor 1 receptoractivatorHumans","Insulin lispro is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration. It is also absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin. Peak serum levels occur 30-90 minutes after injection in healthy subjects. Absorption also differs depending on the site of injection. After insulin lispro was administered in the abdomen, serum drug levels were higher and the duration of action was slightly shorter than after deltoid or thigh administration. The absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous injection ranges from 55% to 77% with doses between 0.1 to 0.2 unit/kg, inclusive.The mean observed area under the serum insulin concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity was 2360 pmol hr/L and 2390 pmol hr/L for HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100, respectively. The corresponding mean peak serum insulin concentration was 795 pmol/L and 909 pmol/L for HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100, respectively. The median time to maximum concentration was 1.0 hour for both formulations.","When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0.1 and 0.2 U/kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects, the mean volume of distribution of insulin lispro appeared to decrease with increase in dose (1.55 and 0.72 L/kg, respectively).",Not Available,Insulin is predominantly cleared by metabolic degradation via a receptor-mediated process.,Not Available,"After subcutaneous administration of insulin lispro, the t1/2 is shorter than that of regular human insulin (1 versus 1.5 hours, respectively).","Clearance is dose dependent.

Insulin glargine,Insulin glargine is a modified form of long-acting or basal insulin used to control hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.,Insulin glargine,DB00047,"Insulin glargine is a long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis.Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin glargine, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as Metformin, Gliclazide, or Sitagliptin have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. Available as the brand name product Lantus, insulin glargine has a duration of action up to 24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Lantus is considered ""basal insulin"" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting ""bolus insulin"" such as Insulin lispro, Insulin glulisine, and Insulin aspart to provide higher doses of insulin that are required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia. Insulin glargine is also available as the biosimilar, or ""follow-on"" product, Basaglar in the US and as Abasaglar in the EU. As of 2015, insulin glargine was reformulated by Sanofi as the product Toujeo in an extra-concentrated form containing 300IU/mL (compared to 100IU/mL contained in Lantus). Use of the higher concentrated Toujeo as compared to Lantus results in slightly different pharmacokinetics, with a later onset (up to 6 hours) and duration of action (up to 30 hours). In 2021, another biosimilar, Semglee (insulin glargine-yfgn),12 became the first interchangeable (with Lantus) biosimilar insulin to receive FDA approval.13Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",Biotech,Approved,Protein Based TherapiesHormones / Insulins,,C267H404N72O78S6,6063.0 Da,>A chainGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCG>B chainFVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTRRDownload FASTA Format,Insulin glargineInsulin glargine (rDNA origin)Insulin glargine recombinantinsulin glargine-yfgnInsulina glargina,"Insulin glargine is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Reduce drug development failure ratesBuild, train, & validate machine-learning modelswith evidence-based and structured datasets.See howBuild, train, & validate predictive machine-learning models with structured datasets.See how","Avoid life-threatening adverse drug eventsImprove clinical decision support with information on contraindications & blackbox warnings, population restrictions, harmful risks, & more.Learn moreAvoid life-threatening adverse drug events & improve clinical decision support.Learn more","Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, the pancreas produces a continuous supply of low levels of basal insulin along with spikes of insulin following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue with a flat and predictable action profile. It is used to mimic the basal levels of insulin in diabetic individuals.","Insulin glargine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signalling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism. Insulin glargine is completely soluble at pH 4, the pH of administered solution, and has low solubility at physiological pH 7.4. Upon subcuteous injection, the solution is neutralized resulting in the formation of microprecipitates. Small amounts of insulin glargine are released from microprecipitates giving the drug a relatively constant concentration over time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. This release mechanism allows the drug to mimic basal insulin levels within the body. TargetActionsOrganismAInsulin receptoragonistHumansUInsulin-like growth factor 1 receptoractivatorHumans","Because of the modifications to the A and B chain, the isoelectric point shifts towards a neutral pH and insulin glargine is more stable in acidic conditions than regular insulin. As insulin glargine is less soluble at neutral pH, once injected, forms microprecipitates. Slow release of insulin glargine from microprecipitates provides a relatively constant concentration of insulin over 24 hours. Onset of action is approximately 1.1 hours. The pharmacokinetic profiles for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of Toujeo in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 (8–14), 12 (12–18), and 16 (12–20) hours, respectively. Steady-state insulin concentrations are reached by at least 5 days of once-daily subcutaneous administration of 0.4 U/kg to 0.6 U/kg doses of Toujeo over 8 days in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.The median time to maximum effect of Basaglar (measured by the peak rate of glucose infusion) was approximately 12.0 hours. The pharmacodynamic profile of Basaglar following subcutaneous injection demonstrated sustained glucose lowering activity over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. The mean area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) and maximum glucose infusion rate were 1670 mg/kg and 2.12 mg/kg/min, respectively. On average, serum insulin concentrations declined to baseline by approximately 24 hours.",Not Available,Not Available,"Insulin glargine is metabolized in the liver into two active metabolites with similar activity to insulin: 21a-Gly-human insulin (M1) and 21a-Gly-des-30b- threonine insulin (M2), with M1 being the predominant metabolite.Hover over products below to view reaction partnersInsulin glargineA21-Gly-des-B30-Thr-insulinA21-Gly-insulin",Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,"Improve decision support & research outcomesWith structured adverse effects data, including: blackbox warnings, adverse reactions, warning & precautions, & incidence rates.Learn moreImprove decision support & research outcomes with our structured adverse effects data.Learn more","Inappropriately high dosages relative to food intake and/or energy expenditure may result in severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia.
